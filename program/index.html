    <h2>Program</h2>
    <p>This lecture series consists of <b>12 weeks</b> with two meetings each, these being: an <b>pre-lecture lecture</b> and an <b>application lecture</b>. The first aims to put every participant "in the same page" regarding a prerequisite of the application lecture of the current week. The latter aims to expose and apply an approach based on the contents explored in the pre-lecture to expand our current understanding of Deep Learning methods. The final week will consist of a panel with the lecturers of previous weeks to discuss the frontlines of this new field. 

    <p>All meetings will be transmited and the links will be posted in this page. Don't worry if you miss any meeting, the recordings will be available at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DataICMC/featured">Data ICMC YouTube Channel</a>!</p>
